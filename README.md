# RideableLizards
Description : <br> 
Grab onto your tamed lizards and ride along with them!

Controls for lizard's abilities are the same as in Safari mode :
- Pickup = Bite
- Jump = Tongue
- Attack = Spit/Jump
- Down + Pickup = Let go of the lizard

Creature shortcuts and dens will be shown whenever riding a tamed lizard, and yes, you can use them!
(P.S. creatures shortcuts don't have the same animations as other pipes do, but they still take as much time to use as travelling a pipe - the downtime period after going into a creature shortcut is not a bug!)

***
Please report any bugs to me! 

P.S.S. - This is not the same as the v1.5 RW version! This is a completely re-written mod, so the gameplay may feel a bit different too.
